       mmoorree is a filter that displays the contents  of  a  binary
       file  on  the  terminal, one screenful at a time.  It nor­
       mally pauses after each screenful, and prints ----MMoorree----  at
       the bottom of the screen.  bbmmoorree provides a two-line over­
       lap between screens for continuity.  If bbmmoorree  is  reading
       from  a file rather than a pipe, the percentage of charac­
       ters displayed so far is also shown.

       bbmmoorree scrolls up  to  display  one  more  screen  line  in
       response  to  a  RETURN  character;  it  displays  another
       screenful in response to a SPACE  character.   Other  com­
       mands are listed below.

       The screen is divided in three sections or panes: The byte
       offset (extreme left), the hex pane (middle), and an ascii
       pane  (right)  which  shows  as printable characters those
       bytes in the hex pane.  On an  80  column  terminal  there
       will  be sixteen hex values and their ASCII values on each
       screen line.  Note that (as one would  expect)  the  first
       byte has the offset 0 (zero).

       bbmmoorree sets the terminal to _n_o_e_c_h_o mode, so that the output
       can be continuous.  Commands that you type do not normally
       show up on your terminal, except for the // , \\ and !!  com­
       mands.

       If the standard output is not a terminal, mmoorree  acts  just
       like  ccaatt(1V), except that a header is printed before each
       file in a series.

              expression  _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.   Note:  unlike  editors, this
              construct should _n_o_t end with a `//'.  If  it  does,
              then  the trailing slash is taken as a character in
              the search pattern.

       The commands take effect immediately;  it is not necessary
       to  type  a carriage return.  Up to the time when the com­
       mand character itself is given, the user may type the line
       kill  character  to  cancel  the  numerical argument being
       formed.  In addition, the user may type the erase  charac­
       ter to redisplay the `----MMoorree----((_x_x%%))' message.

       In the following commands, _i is a numerical argument (11 by
       default).

       _iSPACE    Display another screenful, or _i more lines if  _i
                 is specified.

       _iRETURN   Display another line, or _i more lines, if speci­
                 fied.

       _i^^DD       (CTRL-D) Display (scroll down) 11 more lines.  _i
                 is given, the scroll size is set to _i.

       _id        Same as ^^DD.

       _izz        Same  as  SPACE,  except  that  _i,  if  present,
                 becomes the new  default  number  of  lines  per
                 screenful.

       _iss        Skip _i lines and then print a screenful.

       _iff        Skip _i screenfuls and then print a screenful.

       _i^^BB       (CTRL-B) Skip back _i screenfuls and then print a
                 screenful.

       _b         Same as ^^BB (CTRL-D).

       qq
       QQ         Exit from mmoorree.

       ==         Display the current line number.

       vv         Drop into the bbvvii(1) editor at the current  off­
                 set of the current file.

       ww         Drop  into the bbvvii(1) editor at the current off­
                 set of the current file. Only the portion of the
                 file displayed on the screen will be loaded.

       hh         Help.   Give  a description of all the mmoorree com­
                 mands.

       _i//_p_a_t_t_e_r_n Search for the _ith  occurrence  of  the  regular
                 expression   _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.    Display  the  screenful
                 starting at the file position that contains  the
                 _ith  match for the regular expression _A_S_C_I_I_-_p_a_t_­
                 _t_e_r_n, or the end  of  a  pipe,  whichever  comes
                 first.   If bbmmoorree is displaying a file and there
                 is no such  match,  its  position  in  the  file
                 remains  unchanged.   Regular expressions can be
                 edited using erase and kill characters.  Erasing
                 back  past  the  first column cancels the search
                 command.

       ´´         Single quote.  Go to the point  from  which  the
                 last search started.  If no search has been per­
                 formed in the current file, go to the  beginning
                 of the file.

       !!_c_o_m_m_a_n_d  Invoke  a shell to execute _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.  The charac­
                 ters %% and  !!,  when  used  within  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  are
                 replaced  with the current filename and the pre­
                 vious shell command, respectively.  If there  is
                 no  current filename, %% is not expanded. Prepend
                 a backslash to these characters to escape expan­
                 sion.

       _i::nn       Skip  to the _ith next filename given in the com­
                 mand line, or to the last filename in  the  list
                 if _i is out of range.

       _i::pp       Skip  to  the _ith previous filename given in the
                 command line, or to the first filename if  _i  is
                 out of range.  If given while mmoorree is positioned
                 within a file, go to the beginning of the  file.
                 If  mmoorree  is  reading  from  a pipe, mmoorree simply
                 rings the terminal bell.

       ::ff        Display the current filename and offset  number.

       ::qq
       ::QQ        Exit from bbmmoorree (same as qq or QQ ))..
